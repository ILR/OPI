OPI - Orbital Propagation Interface
-----------------------------------

OPI is an interface with the goal to facilitate the implementation of orbital
propagators into different applications.

To calculate orbital motion, many different software programs exist emphasizing
on different aspects such as execution speed or accuracy. They often require
different input parameters and are written in different languages. This makes
comparing or exchanging them a challenging task. OPI aims at simplifying this
by providing a common way of handling propagation. Propagators using OPI are
designed as plugins/shared libraries that can be loaded by a host program via
the interface.

OPI currently supports C, C++ and Fortran, as well as CUDA for propagators.
Hosts and plugins don't have to be written in the same language in order to
collaborate.
